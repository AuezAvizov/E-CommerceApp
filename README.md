# Military-Shop Companion App

This is a supplementary app for the **Military-Shop** online store, designed for internal users of the platform. The app allows registered users of the Military-Shop to log in or sign up, offering seamless integration between the app and the store.

## Features

- **Fragments & Activities**: The app is built using Android's Fragments and Activities to provide a dynamic and modular user interface.
- **Retrofit Integration**: The app utilizes Retrofit for efficient API communication, though only partially implemented as the main focus is on internal functionalities.
- **User Authentication**: Users can log in or register through the app, with shared authentication across the Military-Shop online store.

## Why was this app created?

This app serves as an extension of the **Military-Shop**. While the main store operates through its website, this companion app was designed to provide a more streamlined experience for internal users. It allows them to manage their activities in both platforms, improving user interaction and enhancing the store's ecosystem.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the installation section to set up the development environment.
3. Use the app either as a standalone user interface or in conjunction with the Military-Shop website.
